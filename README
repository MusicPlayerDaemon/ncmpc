Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ncmpc is a curses client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD). ncmpc connects to 
a MPD running on a machine on the local network, and controls this with an 
interface inspired by cplay. 

Music Player Daemon (MPD) allows remote access for playing music (MP3, 
Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, and wave files) and managing playlists. MPD is 
designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides 
control for music playback over a local network. Read more at musicpd.org



How to compile and install ncmpc
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the INSTALL file.


Upgrading to ncmpc-0.11.0 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The syntax for the configuration file (~/.ncmpc/config) has changed, view the
manual page or the sample configuration file for details.

The old key binding to the select command (space,a) will result in a 
conflict as the a key is used for the new add command in 0.11.0. The easy 
solution is to delete your old key bindings (~/.ncmpc/keys), but you can use 
the built in key editor to solve any key conflicts.



Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ncmpc connects to a MPD running on a machine on the local network. 
By default, ncmpc  connects  to  localhost:6600.   This  can  be
changed  either  at  compile-time,  or  by  exporting  the MPD_HOST and
MPD_PORT environment variables, or by the command line  options  --host
and --port.

	$ ncmpc --host=musicserver --port=44000
